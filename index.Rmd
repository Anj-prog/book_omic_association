# Book overview {#overview}


This book is concerned with the analysis of high dimensional data that is acquired at specific biological domains. The aim of the analyses is the explanation of phenotypic differences among individuals. We, therefore, search for endogenous and exogenous factors that may influence such differences. The endogenous domains on which we turn our attention are those at the molecular level involving basic DNA structure and function, which have been labeled with the \emph{omic} suffix. In particular, we will describe current methods to analyze genomic data, which is high-dimensional at the gene (DNA sequence) level, transcriptomic data involving transcription of DNA into mRNA and epigenomic/methylomic data that relate to the epigenetic modifications of DNA. Many of the methods used at each domain overlap due to the biological nature and high dimensionality of data. However, important specificities remain, some derived from the acquisition of data and others from differences in the underlying biological processes. Within the exogenous domain, we study the high dimensional acquisition of exposure factors that are believed to influence the development or progression of individual traits.    

# Chapter 1 {#chap1}

This chapter provides an overview of _omic_ data as well as the different types of association studies that can be carried out to study the impact of those _omic_ datasets on complex diseases, quantitative traits or any other coditions. Tne chapter continues by providing an outline of the different publicy available databases that allow the users to analyze different _omic_ data. It is illustrated how these data can be accessed using `R`. Finally, Bioconductor an `R` are briefly introduced. 

The `R` code to reproduce the results and figures of this chapter can be found [here]().
